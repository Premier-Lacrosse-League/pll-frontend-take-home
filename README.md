# PLL Take Home Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

Your goal is to create a tool that compares two players and their season stats. The user should be able to choose which stats to compare or compare a list of stats. You have creative freedom on the rest!

### Project Setup
Install all the packages
Run `yarn install` or `npm install`

To run the project run `yarn start` or `yarn start`

### Tasks

- [ ] Commit early and often. It is important to see your thought process. Act like you are collaborating with other engineers on the project.

- [ ] Use MUI styled for styling components (already in package.json)

- [ ] Feel free to use the preset colors and font sizes in consts.ts

- [ ] Use the two players from the sample data in the playerSampleData.ts file

- [ ] Display information about each player that you feel is important. You do not need to use all.

- [ ] Allow a user to choose different stats to compare the players

- [ ] Write a single unit test to test one of your functions


### Testing
To test the project, run `yarn test`. This will run all the tests in the project.

### Submitting
Once you are finished, commit your changes and push them to your forked repo. Make sure to give access to the PLL github accounts to the repo so they can check it
